# Final-Project through the Generation USA Jr Fullstack Java Developer program 3/2022 - 7/2022
Team 5 (Jenny, Khadija, Mikhail)
Angel's R US, an e-commerce page for new mothers and their babies.
As a majority team of mothers, we found that there needed to be a more robust, one-stop solution for maternity shopping that included things not just for babies (Babies-R-Us) but for the mothers as well. This was our first fullstack project that allowed us to practice new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and deployment to Heroku and GitHub pages. We collaborated effectively to pull, review, and merge code from different branches. I led the team to completion in our last section of JavaScript and deployment, and was supported during peer-coding when I got stuck or was going in the wrong direction. Due to time constraints, we had to delete the other pages and focused strictly on the babies page. This helped us finish faster, and boosted the teams confidence and morale as developers because it truly was a team project that we learned to complete together.

# This is my individually finished deployment that has a working backend through Heroku. (Best viewed on Chrome)
May need to request temp access for Cors Proxy to use "About-Us" page functionality that interacts with Heroku.

# Cool Features that we are proud of:
- Form on the About-Us page that allows a user to interact with our backend database. This is our fullstack aspect.
- Cart icon at the top right will update its number of items whenever the user adds an item to the cart.
- Totals section and cart table will update based on whether a user wants to increase or decrease the quantity of a specific item.
